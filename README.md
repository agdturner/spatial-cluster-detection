# spatial-cluster-detection

This is an old project that Andy Turner and I collaborated on sometime ago. 
When Google Code closed I pulled it over here as it might be useful oneday.

It implments a variety of spatial cluster detection methods such as GAM, Besag & Newell, Random circles using GeoTools. 
There is an initial attept at a GeoServer WPS process but I'm not sure it will still work.
